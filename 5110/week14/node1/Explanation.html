    <h1>Feedback</h1>
    <p> My experience with the tutorial overall was satisfactory. I did run into a few problems with testing the actual code,
        but other than that, it was fairly easy to follow. During the tutorial it was easy to follow along with the video and
        the professor's written instructions. I would watch a section of the video and then complete the corresponding code in the tutorial.
    </p><br>
    <p>However, a problem arose when I was trying to connect my database. For some reason, even though I had the exact same code as in the 
        tutorial and in the video, my database wouldn't connect. Therefore later on in the lesson, when we went to test some of out other
        files, the connection to my database would time out, and I wasn't able to see the feedback from the .rest file. Other than that, my server 
        was able to connect, and I was able to view the page rendered from the res.send code. 
    </p><br>
    <p>The video in this tutorial was a bit more fast paced
        than I would have originally perferred, but the instructions/explanations provided by the professor were very helpful. In general, this tutorial helped me to better visualize
        how an application might be set up using Node.js (plus other dependencies) and allowed me to futher understand how JSON and JavaScript 
        objects can potentially be sent over a server.
